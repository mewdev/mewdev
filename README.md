I am fascinated by turning ideas into functional applications. I specialize in the modern stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind), but my path to it has led through a variety of roles. I don't know everything, but I'm a quick learner and problem solver - whether it's code or finding the right tool for the job. If you're looking for a developer for your team with a broad outlook and an appetite for problem solving, don't hesitate to reach out to me.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
